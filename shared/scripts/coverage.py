"""Analysis-coverage contract (enchanter.analysis-report/v1).

Mirrors hydra/shared/scripts/coverage.py. The two repositories are
independent, so the module is duplicated rather than shared; the SCHEMA
constant is the compatibility contract between them.

The law this module exists to enforce:

    ZERO FINDINGS + INCOMPLETE COVERAGE MUST NEVER MEAN CLEAN.

A scanner that returns `[]` is making one of several very different
statements, and callers cannot currently tell them apart:

  * "I analysed this fully and found nothing."          -> complete
  * "I analysed the first 2000 lines and found nothing." -> partial (truncated)
  * "I only match single lines, so cross-line taint is
     invisible to me."                                   -> partial (by depth)
  * "I have no rules for this language at all."          -> unsupported
  * "My backing analyzer is missing/timed out."          -> degraded/unavailable

Only the first one is `clean`. This module makes the distinction explicit
and machine-readable so a downstream tool (or an LLM reviewer) can refuse
to treat an empty finding list as assurance.
